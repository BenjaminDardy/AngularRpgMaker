# AngularRpgMaker
## Why this App

I was a fan of game made with rpgmaker and i wanted find a way to host multiple games online. 
I used to develop app with Spring boot and Angular, so I decided to try to implement a solution with Angular and it worked.

## If you want to use this project

Free to you to use it. Don't forget to change the pom.xml. One big thing to change when adding a game
it's to change some url values in the js files of the games. The url changes are marked with // TODO when changing game.
When you want to add a game you have to create a folder in the assets directory that contains all the
www folder of your game.

# Project
